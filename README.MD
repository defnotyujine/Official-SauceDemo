## SauceDemo Automated Testing Project Description ##

This project contains automated tests for the SauceDemo website (https://www.saucedemo.com/), a sample e-commerce site used for testing purposes. The tests are designed to verify the functionality, usability, performance, and security of the website, ensuring it behaves as expected for different user roles. The tests use Selenium WebDriver with Python.

## Scope of Testing ##
This project covers a wide scope of testing aspects of the web application:
# Functionality
# Usability
# Performance
# Security

This testing was designed to be executed on a Mozilla Firefox browser, additionally it's also worth noting that the platform that has been used for the development of this automates testing strategies is on a Linux environment specifically (OpenSUSE Tumbleweed), but can still be executed on a multi platform as long as dependencies on the *requriements.txt* file are met.
